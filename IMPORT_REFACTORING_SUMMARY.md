# Import Refactoring Summary

## Objective
Move all import statements to the top of Python files and remove defensive import patterns from try-catch blocks across the entire codebase to follow PEP8 standards.

## Files Modified

### ✅ Completed Files

1. **main.py**
   - Moved all healthcare_crl and TRADITIONAL_RULES imports to top level
   - Removed try-catch import blocks
   - Removed redundant `import time` from dashboard loop (already imported at top)

2. **src/healthcare_crl/utils/metrics.py**
   - Moved sys, pathlib, TRADITIONAL_RULES imports to top level
   - Removed defensive import patterns

3. **scripts/get_real_metrics.py**
   - Moved all imports to top level
   - Fixed indentation issues after removing try-catch blocks
   - Maintained script functionality

4. **scripts/run_comprehensive_comparison.py**
   - Moved all imports to top level
   - Removed try-catch import patterns

5. **tests/test_simple_run.py**
   - Moved healthcare_crl and TRADITIONAL_RULES imports to top
   - Fixed indentation and control flow after removing try-catch blocks
   - Maintained test structure

6. **tests/test_real_data_integration.py**
   - Moved all imports to top level
   - Removed duplicate imports
   - Cleaned up try-catch import blocks from all test functions
   - Fixed import paths to use proper healthcare_crl package structure

7. **test_package_structure.py**
   - Moved all healthcare_crl imports to top level
   - Removed redundant imports from try blocks
   - Maintained package testing functionality

### ✅ Files Left Unchanged (Legitimate Use Cases)

1. **setup.py**
   - Contains dynamic import testing during package validation
   - Has optional data generation with graceful error handling
   - These try-catch import patterns are appropriate for setup scripts

## Benefits Achieved

1. **PEP8 Compliance**: All imports now follow Python style guidelines
2. **Better Error Handling**: Import errors are now caught at module load time
3. **Improved Code Clarity**: Dependencies are clearly visible at the top of each file
4. **Consistent Structure**: Uniform import pattern across the entire codebase
5. **Runtime Verification**: All main entry points tested and working correctly

## Technical Notes

- All files maintain their original functionality
- Import errors from linters are expected due to runtime path setup
- The healthcare_crl package structure is properly maintained
- Traditional baseline system integration remains functional

## Verification

✅ All Python files successfully load without import errors
✅ Main entry point (main.py) tested and working
✅ Framework components maintain proper structure
✅ No try-catch import blocks remain in application code

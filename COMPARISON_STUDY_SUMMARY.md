## 🔍 Key Insights

### **CRL's Strategic Advantage**
CRL doesn't just reduce costs—it does so while IMPROVING service level and reliability. This is the holy trinity of supply chain excellence:
- ✅ Lower cost
- ✅ Better service  
- ✅ More reliable partners

### **The Speed Tradeoff**
CRL takes 40% longer to respond (2.8 vs 2.0 days), but for most healthcare operations, this is acceptable because:
- Most decisions aren't true emergencies
- Better planning prevents emergencies
- Cost savings justify minor delays

### **Recommended Use Case**
CRL is ideal for:
- 🏥 Healthcare networks planning supply strategies
- 📊 Operations teams optimizing routine procurement
- 🌍 Managing multi-disruption scenarios
- 💰 Systems with budget constraints
